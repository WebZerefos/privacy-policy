  <h1>4ToDay – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: September 16, 2025</p>

  <p>4ToDay (“the App”) is a personal productivity app. We respect your privacy and are committed to handling your data responsibly.</p>

  <h2>What data we collect</h2>
  <p><strong>On‑device only:</strong> Your tasks, notes, and preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not operate our own servers for user data.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optional iCloud sync:</strong> If you enable iCloud, Apple’s iCloud service stores your app data in your private iCloud account. Apple is the data processor for iCloud; we do not access this data.</li>
    <li><strong>No accounts:</strong> The App does not require you to create an account with us.</li>
    <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> The App does not track you across apps or websites and does not use third‑party advertising SDKs.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics (optional):</strong> If you explicitly share crash logs or feedback via email, we may receive the information you choose to send.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use your data</h2>
  <p>We use data solely to operate the App’s features on your device. Any feedback you send is used to improve the App.</p>

  <h2>Sharing of data</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We do not share data with third parties except:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Service providers you choose, such as Apple iCloud, which is governed by Apple’s terms and privacy policies.</li>
    <li>When required by law, to comply with legal obligations or lawful requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Your on‑device data is protected by your device’s security features (e.g., passcode, Face ID/Touch ID). iCloud data is protected by Apple’s security measures.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may export or delete your data from within the App where available, or by deleting the App from your device.</li>
    <li>You can enable/disable iCloud sync in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

  <h2>International users</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights over your personal data (e.g., access, correction, deletion). Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, contact: <a href="mailto:victor.zerefos@gmail.com">victor.zerefos@gmail.com</a>.<br>
  Legal entity (owner): <em>Victor Manuel Zerefos de Oliveira</em> (4ToDay).</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be noted by updating the “Last updated” date above.</p>
